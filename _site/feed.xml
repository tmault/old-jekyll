        <title>Taking Doors Off Your House</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve migrated from Wordpress to Jekyll. In fact, I haven’t migrated. I’ve just started again from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running on Jekyll is a little more secure - there are fewer points of entry. Wordpress was a big, bloated behemoth, far too powerful for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using my VPS to serve up a static site, I’m removing several layers of potential failure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wordpress could break. No longer a risk. A plugin could inject malware. No longer a threat. Someone could brute force my administrator login. No longer a threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a static html site, there’s nothing client-side to hack. The only way for a malicious party to change things is to gain entry through the server itself - and that is a threat that comes with hosting anything on the internet, regardless of if you’re running Wordpress on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of thought process I’m going through in my life at the moment. It’s a bit like removing doors on your house that you never use. The house is a little bit more secure without them, but it doesn’t decrease your ability to use your house at all.&lt;/p&gt;

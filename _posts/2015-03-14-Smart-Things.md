If you buy twenty pairs of identical socks, you’ll never have to pair socks again. For the rest of your life. Never. Again.

It’s probably not a good idea to buy that ‘fashionable’ loud polo shirt. Or to pay through the roof for a little emblem on your chest. Nobody ever knocked well fitting clothes in solid colours. They minimise the chance of looking silly in photos a decade from now.

Backup your computer off-site.

If it is worth more than £400, you should probably check it will be covered by your contents/possessions insurance.

Watermark and redact information from ID scans before you send them off to third parties. If they are plastered with the date and purpose of identification, they’re going to be of limited use if they fall into the wrong hands.

Don’t use things that aren’t fit for purpose. Don’t use things when your interests don’t align with the vendor. E.g. Backups: pay per GB and use a backup-specific service - not generic (consumer) cloud storage.

Make a list of the applications that you use on your computer. This way, <del>if</del> *when* your computer breaks, you will be able to back up to speed much quicker. Change this file every time you install a new program.

## Principle of Context Awareness 
* BPM can’t follow a cookbook approach - it must fit to the specific organisational context.
* Cookbook approaches lead to project failures.
* What context? Organisational size, strategy, industry, make, objectives and available resources etc.

## Principle of Continuity 
* BPM should be a permanent practice, not just a one-off project.
* BPM isn’t about quick wins.
* Hammer (2010) established that isolated projects (both incremental and radical) can only lead to temporary competitive advantage, as the economic environment and competition will continue to evolve. BPM must become a part of organisational culture.

## Principle of Enablement
* BPM isn’t about firefighting or heroic recovery from failures. It’s about uncovering and developing capabilities.
* BPM is about building the capabilities needed by an organisation now and in the future (Teece, 2009).

## Principle of Holism
* BPM shouldn’t be isolated to specific areas of the organisation.
* The choice of IT systems should not merely meet the local requirements of one function, but rather fit the organisations needs.

## Principle of Institutionalisation 
* BPM needs to become part of the organisational structure. It isn’t an after-thought or ad-hoc responsibility.
* Entrenched habits and adverse circumstances promote silo behaviour, which thwarts the development of horizontal processes.
* Formalising roles and responsibilities for BPM helps ensure the organisation is rebalanced in favour of **customer-centric, horizontal integration of work**.

## Principle of Involvement
* All stakeholders should be integrated into BPM. The employees certainly shouldn’t be neglected.
* Organisational changes can be very threatening and often trigger employee resistance.
* Simple methods, like employee idea boxes and collaborative process modelling can create a sense of involvement, commitment and ownership amongst staff, reducing the amount of resistance changes face.

## Principle of Joint Understanding
* BPM shouldn’t be undertaken solely by experts, in expert language.
* BPM is a mechanism to enable different stakeholders to “view, frame and analyse organisational systems” (Page 537). In order for this to happen, it must be developed using a common, non-domain specific language.

## Principle of Purpose
* BPM contributes to the creation of strategic value. It isn’t done for the sake of doing it.

## Principle of Simplicity
* BPM outlays (time, effort, money etc.) should be economical. They must not be over-engineered.
* Every company should look for the simplest way to achieve its BPM-related goals. They should apply Occam’s Razor.

## Principle of Technology Appropriation
* BPM should make opportune use of technology. 

> Countless IT solutions can be used to foster the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes (Page 538).

* As such, IT is transformative. But it’s about supporting the organisation and the fulfilment of its objectives. It shouldn’t be department specific.
